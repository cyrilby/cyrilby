- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @cyrilby!
- 
- ðŸ‘€ I'm an economist by training but I've been working with data & analytics in the last few years, where a major part of my work has been centered around the use of programming languages such as `R` and `Python`. I've been using this to source data from various places, clean and transform the data and then conduct various kinds of analyses. `R` is definitely my stronger side, but I've been delving into `Python` quite a lot and it has been my primary tool for quite some time.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring different ways of elevating the level of my analytics work, some related to the generation of automated analytics, developing user-friendly interface to communicate my insights and also delving further into the fields of text analytics and machine learning.
